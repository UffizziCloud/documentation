# GitHub Actions Virtual Cluster Example

Follow the example guide below to see how the Uffizzi virtual cluster integration with GitHub Actions works end-to-end. Or you can [skip ahead](/ci/github-actions/virtual-cluster/recipe) to the recipe if you'd rather get started integrating Uffizzi with your project.

## Get Started

<Steps>

### Fork the quickstart repo 

Start by forking the [`quickstart`](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/quickstart) repository on GitHub, if you haven't already.  

<Callout type="warning">
    Be sure to uncheck the option **Copy the `main` branch only**. This ensures that the `try-uffizzi` branch will be included in your fork.  
</Callout>

/>
<br />

### Enable GitHub Actions workflows
Enable GitHub Actions workflows for your fork by selecting **Actions**, then select **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**.

    width={640}
    height={433}
    alt="Enable GitHub Actions"
    className="border rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6"
/>

### Open a PR  

Open a pull request for `try-uffizzi` branch against `main` in your fork.  

<Callout type="warning">
    Be sure that you're opening a PR on the branches of _your fork_ (i.e. `your-account/main` ← `your-account/try-uffizzi`). If you try to open a PR for `UffizziCloud/main` ← `your-account/try-uffizzi`, the Actions workflow will not run in this example. 
</Callout>

    height={541}
    alt="Open a pull request"
    className="border rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6"
/>
<br />

</Steps>

## What to expect

The PR will trigger a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/quickstart-k8s/blob/main/.github/workflows/uffizzi.yml) that uses the Uffizzi CLI and Kubernetes manifests to create a Uffizzi ephemeral environment for the [microservices application](#architecture-of-this-example-app) defined by the repo. When the workflow completes, the ephemeral environment URL will be posted as a comment in your PR issue.

<Callout>
    This virtual cluster is configured with a [Uffizzi Ingress](/ingress), which makes the `web` service available at a predictable URL, consisting of `https://app.uffizzi.com/` appended with the GitHub pull request domain. For example:  
    `https://app.uffizzi.com/github.com/{account}/{repo}/pull/{pull-request-number}`.  

    You can make requests to specific endpoints by appending a route to the end of the URL. For example:  
    `https://app.uffizzi.com/github.com/boxyhq/jackson/pull/661/api/health`  

    To learn how to enable predicable URLs for your ephemeral environments, see the [Uffizzi Ingress(/docs/ingress) documentation].

</Callout>

## How it works

Ephemeral environments are configured with a [Kubernetes manifest](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/quickstart/tree/main/k8s) that describes the application components and a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/quickstart/blob/main/.github/workflows/uffizzi-cluster.yaml) that includes a series of jobs triggered by `pull_request` events. 

When a pull request is open/closed/reopened/updated, the workflow will run the following jobs:

1. Build and Push the Image
2. Create a virtual cluster using the Uffizzi CLI in a GitHub Actions runner  
3. Apply a kustomization to deploy the application on the virtual cluster
4. Post a new comment or update an existing comment with the ephemeral environment URL and instructions for accessing the environment
5. Delete the virtual cluster when the PR is closed or merged

## Connecting to the Cluster

To run `kubectl` commands on this cluster, first update your kubeconfig by running:  

``` bash
uffizzi cluster update-kubeconfig [CLUSTER_NAME]
```

<Callout>
    **Tip**: We recommend using the pull request number for cluster names to make it easy to connect to your clusters, e.g.: `uffizzi cluster update-kubeconfig pr-281`  
</Callout>

To find the ingress of this deployment, run:   

``` bash
kubectl get ingress web --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config -o json | jq '.spec.rules[0].host' | tr -d '"'
```


## Next Steps  

Now that you've seen the process from start to finish, **add Uffizzi to your own project** on GitHub.
