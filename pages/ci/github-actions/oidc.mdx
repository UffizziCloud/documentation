# Authenticating via OpenID Connect

Using the official Uffizzi [Cluster Action](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/cluster-action) or [Preview Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/preview-environments), GitHub Actions workflows authenticate with Uffizzi Cloud via OpenID Connect (OIDC) JSON Web Tokens (JWT).  

Every time a job runs, GitHub's OIDC Provider automatically generates an OIDC token, which is signed by GitHub to verify the workflow runner's identity. When this token is passed to the preview action, Uffizzi verifies the signature on the token to confirm that the request came from GitHub and the identity of the requester (i.e., the GitHub username). No other credentials are needed by Uffizzi to authenticate a request. This point is worth emphasizing: **you do not need a password to authenticate with Uffizzi**. In fact, when the cluster workflow runs for the first time, Uffizzi will automatically create an account from the metadata of the OIDC JWT, so it's not even necessary to first create an account at uffizzi.com before seeing your previews.
