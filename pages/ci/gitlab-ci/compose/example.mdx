# GitLab CI Compose Example

Create a Docker Compose environment from a GitLab CI pipleine.

<Steps>

### Fork the quickstart repository

Start by forking the the [quickstart](https://gitlab.com/uffizzicloud/quickstart-gitlab-ci) repository on GitLab. From the project home page, select **Fork**, then choose a namespace and project slug. Select **Fork project**.

<br />
<Image

    width={640}
    height={433}
    alt="Fork quickstart repo"
    className="border rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6"
/>
<br />
<Image
    src="/images/quickstart-gitlab-fork-2.png"
    width={640}
    height={433}
    alt="Select fork"
    className="border rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6"
/>
<br />

### Enable CI/CD 

Ensure GitLab CI/CD is enabled for your project. If you don't see the `**Build > Pipelines**` option in left sidebar, following [these steps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/enable_or_disable_ci.html#enable-cicd-in-a-project) to enable it.

<br />
<Image
    src="/images/quickstart-gitlab-build-pipelines.png"
    width={640}
    height={433}
    alt="Enable CI/CD"
    className="border rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6"
/>
<br />

### Open a Merge Request

Open a merge request (MR) for `try-uffizzi` branch against `master` in your fork.

<Callout type="warning">
    Be sure that you’re opening the MR on the branches of _your fork_ (i.e. `your-account/master` ← `your-account/try-uffizzi`).
</Callout>

If you try to open a MR for `uffizzi/quickstart/~/tree/master` ← `your-account/~/tree/try-uffizzi`, the pipeline will not run in this example.

<br />
<Image
    src="/images/quickstart-gitlab-create-mr.png"
    width={640}
    height={433}
    alt="Open a merge request"
    className="border rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6"
/>
<br />

This will kick off a GitLab pipeline and the ephemeral environment URL will be dumped to `stdout` of the pipeline job. 

</Steps>

## What to expect

The MR will trigger a pipeline defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/uffizzicloud/quickstart-gitlab-ci/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) that creates a Uffizzi ephemeral environment for the microservices application defined by the repo. The ephemeral environment URL will be echoed to `stdout` of the `deploy_environment` Job. Look for the following line in the Job logs:

```
$ echo "Uffizzi Environment deployment details at URI:${UFFIZZI_CONTAINERS_URI}"
Uffizzi Environment deployment details at URI:https://app.uffizzi.com//projects/8526/deployments/27720/containers
```

This link will take you to the Uffizzi Dashboard where you can view application logs and manage your environments and team. The environment will be deleted when the MR is merged/closed or after 1 hour ([configurable](https://gitlab.com/uffizzicloud/quickstart-gitlab-ci/-/blob/master/docker-compose.uffizzi.yml#L7)).

You might also want to configure a new Job to post the URL as a comment to your MR issue or send a notification to Slack, MS Teams, etc. See our Slack notification example [here](https://gitlab.com/uffizzi/environment-action/-/blob/main/Notifications/slack.yml).
  
## How it works 

Ephemeral environments are configured with a [Docker Compose template](https://gitlab.com/uffizzicloud/quickstart-gitlab-ci/-/blob/master/docker-compose.uffizzi.yml) that describes the application components and a [GitLab CI pipeline](https://gitlab.com/uffizzicloud/quickstart-gitlab-ci/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) that includes a series of jobs triggered by a `merge_request_event`:

1. [Build and push images to a container registry](https://gitlab.com/uffizzicloud/quickstart-gitlab-ci/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L14)
2. [Render a Docker Compose file from the Docker Compose template and the built images](https://gitlab.com/uffizzicloud/quickstart-gitlab-ci/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L56-76)
3. [Deploy the application to a Uffizzi ephemeral environment and echo the environment URL to the Job logs](https://gitlab.com/uffizzi/environment-action/-/blob/main/environment.gitlab-ci.yml#L30-76)
4. [Delete the environment](https://gitlab.com/uffizzi/environment-action/-/blob/main/environment.gitlab-ci.yml#L98-115)

<Callout>
    Each ephemeral environment is available at a predictable URL which consists of `https://app.uffizzi.com/` appended with the GitLab merge request domain. For example:  
    `https://app.uffizzi.com/gitlab.com/{account}/{repo}/merge_requests/{merge-request-number}`.  

    You can make requests to specific endpoints by appending a route to the end of the URL. For example:  
    `https://app.uffizzi.com/gitlab.com/acme/example-app/pull/661/api/health`  
</Callout>

Running this workflow will create a [Uffizzi Cloud](https://uffizzi.com) account and project from your GitLab user and repo information, respectively. If you sign in to the [Uffizzi Dashboard](https://app.uffizzi.com/sign_in) you can view logs, password protect your environments, manage projects and team members, set role-based access controls, and configure single-sign on (SSO).
