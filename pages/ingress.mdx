# Uffizzi Cluster Ingress

When you create an Ingress within your Virtual Cluster, you may choose for Uffizzi's load balancer to implement it, or you may implement it with your own load balancer. These options are specified with the [`spec.ingressClassName` attribute](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class).

## Default IngressClass `uffizzi`

If your Ingress does not specify an `ingressClassName`, or it explicitly specifies `ingressClassName: uffizzi`, then Uffizzi's load balancer will implement it using a generated hostname and a trusted HTTPS certificate.

Any `host` values will be replaced by unique hostnames with the following format:
```
<ingress-name>-<virtual-namespace>-<ucluster-name>-<ucluster-id>.uclusters.app.uffizzi.com
```

This allows cluster users to quickly start testing their serivces and routing traffic from the outside world without having to configure hostnames manually or provisioning their own Ingress controller.

If you're using [dev clusters](/dev-environments/dev-clusters) with the `uffizzi` IngressClass, you can easily find and open the provisioned hostname with the `uffizzi dev ingress open` command.

### Example: Uffizzi-implemented Ingress

This minimal Ingress does not specify an `ingressClassName`, nor does it specify any `host` within its `rules`. That's fine! Uffizzi will configure the rest:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-example
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: service-nginx-example
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
```

After you create this Ingress, look again and see that Uffizzi has updated it:

```yaml {7,9,22}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-example
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: uffizzi
  rules:
  - host: ingress-example-default-k8s-1-27.uclusters.app.uffizzi.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: service-nginx-example
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - ip: 34.71.28.140
```

HTTP requests to that hostname will be redirected to HTTPS and secured with Uffizzi's trusted certificate. DNS records are already in place. It's ready to serve traffic!

If you wish to define a custom IngressClass, instead, you still can, as described below.

## Custom IngressClass

You can also bring your own IngressClass, and install the necessary controller and load balancer on your virtual cluster. Custom IngressClasses on Uffizzi virtual clusters and dev clusters are configured just like they are for a standard Kubernetes cluster.

Follow [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class) for understanding what an IngressClass is and how you can implement it with your chosen Ingress controller. You'll need to specify `spec.ingressClassName` for all your Ingresses implemented by this controller.
