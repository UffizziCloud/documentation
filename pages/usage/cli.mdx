# Using Uffizzi from the CLI

This guide explains common ways of using Uffizzi to manage ephemeral environments. It assumes that you have already [installed](install.md) the Uffizzi CLI.

If just want to run a few quick commands, you may want to start with one of the [Quickstart Guides](/quickstart). Otherwise, this guide covers example usage not described in the quickstarts.

### Configuring the CLI

You can configure the Uffizzi CLI using the `config` subcommand. The configuration is stored in `~/.config/uffizzi/config_default.json`. 

``` bash
uffizzi config
```

Use the `list` subcommand to view the current configuration:  

``` bash
uffizzi config list
```

Set the value of the specified property, like `project`:

``` bash
uffizzi config set project my-project-fwyt
```

Get the value of the specified property, like `server`:

``` bash
uffizzi config get-value server
```

### Creating and managing clusters

#### Cluster creation and workload deployments

Use the Uffizzi CLI to create environments from a local directory. When you create an environment, the Uffizzi CLI will update the kubeconfig file you specify with a cluster hostname and certificate you can use to connect, as well as, update your current context. Here we create a cluster with the Uffizzi CLI:

``` bash
uffizzi cluster create my-cluster -k ~/.kube/config
```

Then apply the manifests from a local directory with `kubectl`:

``` bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

Alternately, we can create a cluster and apply the manifests in a single Uffizzi command:

``` bash
uffizzi cluster create -n my-cluster -k ~/.kube/config -m manifests/
```

<Callout>
    Note that you can alternatively use `kustomization.yaml` files with `kubectl` or `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` files with the `helm` command.
</Callout>

To connect to an existing Uffizzi cluster, you can run the `update-kubeconfig` command with the name of the cluster you're targeting and the location of your kubeconfig file:

``` bash
uffizzi cluster update-kubeconfig my-cluster -k ~/.kube/config
```
See the [CLI Reference](references/cli.md#cluster-update-kubeconfig) for how Uffizzi handles kubeconfig updates.

#### Accessing services created inside the cluster

If you are creating ingresses explicitly in your manifests without a specific IngressClass. Uffizzi will dynamically set a hostname for all such ingresses created inside the ephemeral cluster environment. The naming of the ingress follows the convention as follows

```
<ingress-name>-<virtual-namespace>-<virtual-cluster-name>.<host-namespace>.uclusters.app.uffizzi.com
```

This allows us to keep the let users have easy access to their services through the ingress while keeping a more deterministic naming convention for the hostname without any extra configuraiton required to set up the hostname.

### Creating and managing dev clusters

#### Dev evnvironment creation and workload deployments

Use the Uffizzi CLI to create environments from a local directory (support for remote Chart repositories is coming soon). When you create an environment, the Uffizzi CLI will update the kubeconfig file you specify with a cluster hostname and certificate you can use to connect, as well as, update your current context. Here we create a cluster with the Uffizzi CLI:

``` bash
uffizzi cluster create -n my-cluster -k ~/.kube/config --update-current-context
```

Then apply the manifests from a local directory with `kubectl`:

``` bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

Alternately, we can create a cluster and apply the manifests in a single Uffizzi command:

``` bash
uffizzi cluster create -n my-cluster -k ~/.kube/config -m manifests/
```

To connect to an existing Uffizzi cluster, you can run the `update-kubeconfig` command with the name of the cluster you're targeting and the location of your kubeconfig file:

``` bash
uffizzi cluster update-kubeconfig my-cluster -k ~/.kube/config
```
See the [CLI Reference](references/cli.md#cluster-update-kubeconfig) for how Uffizzi handles kubeconfig updates.

#### Accessing services created inside the cluster

If you are creating ingresses explicitly in your manifests without a specific IngressClass. Uffizzi will dynamically set a hostname for all such ingresses created inside the ephemeral cluster environment. The naming of the ingress follows the convention as follows

```
<ingress-name>-<virtual-namespace>-<virtual-cluster-name>.<host-namespace>.uclusters.app.uffizzi.com
```

This allows us to keep the let users have easy access to their services through the ingress while keeping a more deterministic naming convention for the hostname without any extra configuraiton required to set up the hostname.

### Creating and managing Docker Compose environments

Use the `preview` command to create an ephemeral environment from a Docker Compose configuration.

<Callout>
    Uffizzi supports a subset of the of the complete [Compose specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md). Uffizzi also requires some additional configuration that is not included in the Compose specification, most notably an `ingress` definition. See the [Uffizzi Compose File Reference](references/compose-spec.md) for more detail on what is required for your `docker-compose.uffizzi.yml` file. For help writing this file or for using it in CI pipelines to create pull request environments, see [this guide](docker-compose-environment.md).
</Callout>

**Create a Docker Compose preview environment**

In the following example, we pass a `docker-compose.uffizzi.yml` from our local development environment. This command will create a preview environment for this compose file in the default account and project. 

``` bash
uffizzi preview create docker-compose.uffizzi.yml
```

<Callout>
    The Uffizzi CLI **does not** build containers for you from your local environment even if your environment includes a `DOCKERFILE`. Instead, you should execute a build step first, and then add images in your Docker Compose configuration (i.e. use the `image` directive instead of the `build` directive). Uffizzi Cloud customers can use [Uffizzi CI](references/uffizzi-ci.md) if they want Uffizzi to build container images from source, or you can use another build service like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI. You can learn more about Uffizzi CI [here](references/uffizzi-ci.md).
</Callout>

**Add metadata labels**

You can add metadata labels to any preview using the `--set-labels` option:

``` bash
uffizzi preview create docker-compose.uffizzi.yml \
  --set-labels="github.repo=my_repo github.pull_request.number=23"
```
