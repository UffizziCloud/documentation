# Using Uffizzi from a CI Pipeline

In addition to creating environments from the Uffizzi [CLI](/usage/cli) or [Dashboard](/usage/dashboard), you can configure a continuous integration (CI) service to automatically deploy new environments for certain events, like pull request/merge requests. Each time your push a new commit, your environment will be automatically updated, and when you close a pull request/merge request, the environment will be deleted.

## CI Examples

Before you add Uffizzi to your own project, you might want to first try one of the examples below. These examples use a pre-configured repo that:  
- Creates an **ephemeral environment when you open a PR**  
- **Posts a comment to the PR issue** with instructions on how to access the environment
