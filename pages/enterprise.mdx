# Uffizzi Enterprise

Uffizzi Enterprise offers the fastest, most cost efficient, and capable hosted Kubernetes Developer Platform on the market.  

Uffizzi Enterprise is a robust, highly scalable and customizable platform that is designed for large organizations who want the productivity benefits of an Internal Developer Platform without the operational and staffing burden of building, updating, and maintaining a similar capability.  

Uffizzi's unique solution allows Enterprises to outsource their Developer Platform while maintaining complete control and visibility.  Enterprise directors will be given direct access to underlying infrastructure at the project level while Uffizzi maintains responsibility for the management, updating, and availability of all systems.  

Uffizzi covers your every ephemeral environment use case - it can be used for remote and hybrid cluster-based Develop Environments, fully integrated CI Preview Environments, automated test environments, load test environments, ad hoc staging or release environments, and sales or demo environments.  

Enterprise customer workloads run within a private project and on dedicated infrastructure that can be customized for their every use case and in accordance with their specific cloud resource requirements.  This enables Enterprise to stand up their developer platform in minutes, to take advantages of Uffizzi's ongoing innovation, and to reduce staffing requirement burdens of building and maintaining your own developer platform.
