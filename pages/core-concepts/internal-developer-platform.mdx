# Internal Developer Platform

## What is an IDP? 

An **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)** is a system of workflows and tools assembled to create streamlined, standard paths for developers, promoting a self-service approach. To facilitate these "[golden paths](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/)", an IDP integrates a variety of technologies and tools in a cohesive manner, organized to reduce the cognitive load on developer end-users.

The key here is that an IDP isn't just slapped together. **Platform teams treat their platform like a product.** They use user research to build an IDP and are committed to maintaining and continually improving it.

## 5 Core Components of an IDP

An IDP is comprised of five core components [[1](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/core-components/)], described in the table below, which are designed to standardize configurations, 
automate processes, and enforce role-based access. Uffizzi facilitates the 5 core components of an IDP as follows:

| 5 Core Components                     | Component Description                                         | How Uffizzi Facilitates This Component                               |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application Configuration Management** | Dynamically handle scalable application settings   | Supports configuration standards like Helm, kustomize, and Docker Compose |
| **Infrastructure Orchestration**        | Smart, context-aware infrastructure arrangement    | Utilizes container and cloud-native, Kubernetes-based infrastructure  |
| **Environment Management**              | Empower devs with on-demand, ready-to-use environments | Offers secure, self-serve [ephemeral environments](ephemeral-environments), managed via CLI or CI/CD |
| **Deployment Management**               | Establish continuous delivery/deployment pipelines | Enables automated deployment, rollback/clean-up, and versioning  |
| **Role-based Access Control**           | Scale permission settings efficiently              | Provides secure, isolated environments for each team member (with admin controls) |

**Is Uffizzi an IDP?**
Yes and no. For many teams these 5 components provided by Uffizzi satisfy their requirements for enabling developer self-service. Yet other teams may need to incorporate more tools to address their particular needs. In either case, Uffizzi acts as a secure, customizable foundation upon which you can build out your IDP.

## Benefits of an IDP

**For Ops Teams:**
- Streamlines resource allocation and management
- Standardizes application configurations through templates
- Enhances access control
- Automates setup of environments and resources
- Simplifies operational setup

**For Developers:**
- Increases autonomy in resource management and deployment
- Integrates with existing workflows
- Simplifies environment provisioning
- Facilitates autonomous deployments and rollbacks
