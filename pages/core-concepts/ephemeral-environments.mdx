# Ephemeral Environments

Ephemeral environments, unlike traditional persistent staging or production environments, are created on-demand and are intended to be short-lived, existing only as long as they are needed. Some example use cases for ephemeral environments include:  

- Individual developer environments
- Feature branch environments
- Pull request environments
- Testing environments
- Debugging / hotfix environments
- Release candidate environments
- Staging environments

In addition to their ephemeral nature, they are also provide isolation from other ephemeral development and test environments, making them a perfect companion to IDPs.

## Three Types of Ephemeral Environments

Uffizzi currently supports three types of ephemeral environments: virtual clusters, dev clusters, and compose environments.

### Virtual Cluster Environments
[Virtual Clusters](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/virtual-clusters) are Kubernetes-based environments built from a Kubernetes specificationâ€”typically [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh), [kustomizations](https://kustomize.io), or standard manifests applied by [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/). Virtual clusters are fully functional Kubernetes clusters that run in isolation on top of a host cluster. Once you've created these clusters with the Uffizzi [CLI](usage/cli), [Dashboard](/usage/dashboard) or from your [CI pipeline](/usage/ci), you can use standard Kubernetes tools like `kubectl` and `helm` to manage them and their configurations.

### Dev Cluster Environments
[Dev Clusters](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/dev-clusters) are virtual clusters intended to be used for interactive cloud-based development on Kubernetes. By shifting the compute from your local machine to a remote server environment, Uffizzi dev environments great for resource-intensive applications or for standardizing your development configuration for every member of your team.

### Compose Environments 
[Compose environments](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/compose) are container-based environments built from a Docker Compose specification. You can read more about Uffizzi's support for the Compose specification [here](/compose-spec).
