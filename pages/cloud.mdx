# Uffizzi Cloud

Uffizzi Cloud is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering that streamlines and simplifies the containerized application preview process. Unlike [Uffizzi Enterprise](enterprise), which is tailored for private managed installations, Uffizzi Cloud serves developers and organizations looking for a seamless, cloud-based solution that integrates directly with their version control and CI/CD pipelines. This product is designed to enhance developer productivity and collaboration by automatically creating disposable ephemeral environments for dev, test, pull requests, staging, demos, and more.  

The simplicity of integration with existing workflows means that there is no steep learning curve or heavy lifting required from the development teams. Additionally, with the infrastructure management being entirely handled by the Uffizzi team, customers can focus solely on building and refining their end-to-end development and test workflows. Users can get started quickly, enjoy the benefits of a fully managed service, and scale as needed, all the while receiving comprehensive support from the Uffizzi Cloud experts.
Try Uffizzi for free, and get started creating your first environment in seconds.
