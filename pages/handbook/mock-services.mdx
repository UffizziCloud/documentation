# Mock Services

It's sometimes useful to mock out services in your tests in the context of an ephemeral environmentâ€”this way you can feel confident that you're not making changes to a shared service. For example, as discussed in [Do's and Don'ts](/handbook/dos-and-donts), you should avoid manipulating stateful external services from your Uffizzi environments.  

If the service you want to mock is in the AWS catalog, we recommend using [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) which provides containerized APIs for many AWS services. Some popular mock services include:  

- [IAM](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/iam/)  
- [Lambda](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/lambda/)  
- [Kenisis](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/kinesis/)  
- [Secrets Manager](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/secretsmanager/)
- [SNS](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/sns/)  
- [SQS](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/sqs/)
