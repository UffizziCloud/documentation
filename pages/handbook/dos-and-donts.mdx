# The Do's and Don'ts of Ephemeral Environments

## Data

**Don't store critical data in ephemeral environments!**   

When an ephemeral environment is deleted, all its resources, **including persistent volumes**, are deleted. Uffizzi ephemeral 
environments are intended for development and testing, not production. 

**Do seed test data when the environment is created** 

When adding data to an ephemeral environment you should seed it on start up (See [Database Seeding](/handbook/managing-state/database-seeding)). 
Any data that should persist beyond the lifecycle of an ephemeral environment, should be store it outside the environment, such as in object (bucket) storage.

## External Services (Stateful)

**Don't manipulate stateful external services from ephemeral environments!**  

If in every ephemeral environment you're writing to or deleting from external databases, queues, and other stateful external services, 
you're going to have a mess on your hands. Even if you're careful, you can't be sure if other team members are manipulating 
the same services. It's best to limit your interactions to stateless services, or at least perform read-only operations on the external 
stateful services. 

**Do create mock services or internal copies of stateful services**

If you need to manipulate stateful services, you should [mock the service](/handbook/mock-services) or create a copy  
that is internal to your environment, such as with [containerized databases](/handbook/managing-state/database-seeding), so 
they are isolated from other team member environments.

## Production 

**Don't use ephemeral environments for production or persistent hosting!**  

Uffizzi ephemeral environments are intended for development and testing purposes only. In addition to providing no gaurantees of 
availability, Uffizzi environments sleep by default after a period of inactivity (See [Uffizzi Cloud plans](/products/uffizzi-cloud)). 
Additionally, Uffizzi environments have default resource limits, depending on your plan, so they may not scale to meet production demands.

**Do use ephemeral environments for development and testing**

Use Uffizzi [dev clusters](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/dev-clusters) for continuous development and deployment and 
[virtual clusters](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/virtual-clusters) to test pre-production releases or against [different versions of 
Kubernetes](/cli/commands/cluster#cluster-create).

## CI Pipelines

**Do configure Uffizzi with your CI platform**  

In addition to creating ephemeral environments from the [Uffizzi CLI](/cli), you can also add Uffizzi to your 
GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other CI platform. This will allow you to create ephemeral environments every time a team member 
opens a pull request. Incorporating Uffizzi in your CI process has many benefits including the ability to paralellize automated 
tests and avoid the flakiness and resource contraints of running CI tests in pipeline runners. See our [CI guides](/ci) for 
detailed integration instructions.

**Don't forget to update and delete ephemeral environments from your CI pipeline!**  

Be sure to add a job to your pipeline that watches for new push events and pull request close events, so your ephemeral 
environments are updated or deleted as necessary.
