  **What's the difference?**  
  Stardard [virtual clusters](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/virtual-clusters) are packaged with a [k3s](https://k3s.io) certified Kubernetes distribution. [DevÂ clusters](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/dev-clusters) are standard virtual clusters with additional developer tooling for building, testing, and auto-deploying your local project files.
