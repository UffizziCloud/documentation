# `dev`  

Manage Uffizzi [dev clusters](/docs/core-concepts/dev-clusters)  

Use these commands for building, pushing, and deploying your
    project changes to a remote development cluster. Cloud-based
    dev environments offer many benefits compared to traditional
    local development, including:  
      - More similar to production deployments
      - Access to more memory and CPU for resource-intensive
        apps
      - Scalability and flexibility for microservices apps
      - Faster build times
      - Avoid accumulation of build artifacts on local machine
      - App components available at public URLs or IP addresses
      - TLS certificates for HTTPS
      - Better team collaboration via shareable links

file in directory '~/foo', run:

``` bash
uffizzi dev start ~/foo/skaffold.yaml
