# `dev`  

Manage Uffizzi [dev clusters](/docs/core-concepts/dev-clusters)  

Use these commands for building, pushing, and deploying your
    project changes to a remote development cluster. Cloud-based
    dev environments offer many benefits compared to traditional
    local development, including:  
      - More similar to production deployments
      - Access to more memory and CPU for resource-intensive
        apps
      - Scalability and flexibility for microservices apps
      - Faster build times
      - Avoid accumulation of build artifacts on local machine
      - App components available at public URLs or IP addresses
      - TLS certificates for HTTPS
      - Better team collaboration via shareable links

## `dev start`  

Creates a Uffizzi dev cluster and starts the Skaffold process  

This command watches for file changes in a given local
project directory, as specified in your configuration file.
It then serializes those changes and redeploys them onto
a Uffizzi dev cluster.

``` bash
uffizzi dev start [CONFIG_FILE] [OPTIONS]
```

### Positional Arguments
    `[CONFIG_FILE]`  
    Path to the development environment configuration file.
    Currently supports [skaffold.yaml](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/) files.

    The `CONFIG_FILE` location is stored in `~/.configu/uffizzi/config_default.json`, so you can run `uffizzi dev start` from 
    anywhere in your filesystem.  

### Options

| Option                    | Description                                                                                |
| --------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--k8s-version`           | Specify which version of the Kubernetes API to use when creating the cluster, formatted as `[MAJOR].[MINOR]`. Defaults to `1.27`. Minor versions point to the latest release of the corresponding k3s minor version. See https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases|
| `--default-repo`          | A public or private repo used to push/pull build artifacts. Overrides the global default image registry: `registry.uffizzi.com`.|
| `-q`, `--quiet`           | Suppress output                                                                            |
| `-k`, `--kubeconfig`      | This option specifies the location of the kubeconfig file to create or update              |

### Example Usage

To start a dev environment using a skaffold.yaml config
file in directory '~/foo', run:

``` bash
uffizzi dev start ~/foo/skaffold.yaml
```  

To start a dev environment in quiet  mode,
run:

``` bash copy
uffizzi dev start --quiet
```
To start a dev environment using an alternate kubeconfig file,
run:

``` bash
uffizzi dev start --kubeconfig="/path/to/alternate/kubeconfig"
```

## `dev stop` 

Stops the skaffold process for the dev environment. 
This command does not delete the dev cluster or any 
associated resources. You can restart the dev environment
with `uffizzi dev start`. To delete the dev cluster entirely,
see `uffizzi dev delete`.

``` bash
uffizzi dev stop
```

## `dev delete`  

Deletes the backing dev cluster resources, including any persistent
volumes, and the namespace itself. The dev cluster config is deleted 
from the kubeconfig file.  

``` bash copy
uffizzi dev delete
```
