# Resource Quotas & Limits

Uffizzi virtual clusters are designed with specific resource limits and quotas to ensure optimal performance and resource availability for all users. These hard caps are in place to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the shared infrastructure. The predefined limits include CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage, alongside counts on Kubernetes-specific resources like pods, services, and persistent volume claims. These measures are taken to provide a balanced environment that can reliably serve the needs of various applications while managing the underlying resources effectively.

Should you find that the standard resource allocation does not align with your requirements, you can request a quota increase by contacting us at support@uffizzi.com.
