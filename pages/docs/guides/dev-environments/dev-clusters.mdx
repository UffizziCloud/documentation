# Getting Started with Dev Clusters

To create a [dev cluster](/docs/core-concepts/dev-clusters), you'll need two things:

1. **A [`skaffold.yaml`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/) file**  
2. **Your application's configuration files** - typically Helm Charts, kustomizations or Kubernetes manifests

Dev clusters can be easily created from the Uffizzi Cloud [dashboard](https://app.uffizzi.com) or from the CLI 
by running `uffizzi dev start` from the root of your project directory or passing your `skaffold.yaml` file as 
an argument if it exists somewhere else:

```bash
uffizzi dev start /path/to/skaffold.yaml
```

This command will also save the location of your skaffold file in the CLI configuration `.config/uffizzi/config_default.json`.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-project" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="api" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="web" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="cmd" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="pkg" />
    <FileTree.File name="go.mod" />
    <FileTree.File name="main.go" />
    <FileTree.File name="skaffold.yaml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Example Skaffold File

Skaffold files are relatively simple files that at a minium define `build` and `manifest` components. 
Most of the configuration happens in your Charts or manifests, not in the `skaffold.yaml` file itself. 
For example, this is the skaffold file we use for developing the Uffizzi Cloud platform, which despite 
being comprised of a half a dozen services, is only about 20 lines of YAML:

```yaml filename="skaffold.yaml"
apiVersion: skaffold/v4beta6
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: uffizzi-platform
    context: .
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    sync:
      infer:
      - "**/*"
manifests:
  helm:
    releases:
      - name: uffizzi
        chartPath: "charts/uffizzi-platform"
        skipBuildDependencies: true
        valuesFiles:
          - ".helm_values.yaml"
```


To stop the skaffold process, you can press `Ctrl+C`, or if you started the dev cluser in quiet mode, run 
`uffizzi dev stop` in another terminal. If you stop the skaffold process, it will halt file synchronization, 
but it will not delete the dev cluster. To do that you can run `uffizzi dev delete`, which will destroy the 
entire dev cluster and all of its resources, including any persistent volumes you've created.
