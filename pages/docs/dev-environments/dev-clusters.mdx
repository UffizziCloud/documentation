# Using Dev Clusters

Uffizzi [dev clusters](/docs/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/dev-clusters) let you code locally in your favorite IDE and see your changes automatically reflected in your deployed services in 
real-time. 

Dev clusters provide [many benefits](/docs/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/dev-clusters) compared to traditional 
local development environments, including standardizing developer workflows and offloading compute to remote servers.

  **Feature Spotlight**  
  One of the primary benefits of using Uffizzi Dev Clusters is the option to use the [Uffizzi Dev 
  Ingress](/dev-environments/ingress) service. With this option enabled, Uffizzi will provision for your dev environment its 
  own URL (with a unique domain and TLS certificate), allowing you to test your application with HTTPS and enforce a more 
  [production-like](/docs/core-concepts/production-like) configuration.

## Requirements
To create a [dev cluster](/docs/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/dev-clusters), you'll need two things:

1. **A [`skaffold.yaml`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/) file**  
2. **Your application's configuration files** - typically Helm Charts, kustomizations or Kubernetes manifests

## Setup

Dev clusters can be easily created from the [Uffizzi Cloud dashboard](/docs/usage/dashboard) or from the CLI 
by running [`uffizzi dev start`](/docs/cli/commands/dev), passing your `skaffold.yaml` file as an argument:

```bash
uffizzi dev start /path/to/skaffold.yaml
```

This command will also save the location of your skaffold file in the CLI configuration `.config/uffizzi/config_default.json`.

### Create a Skaffold file
Uffizzi dev clusters require a [`skaffold.yaml`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/) configuration file 
that defines how your build artifacts are managed and where to find your application configuration files, such as 
Helm Charts or kustomizations. 

If you've never used Skaffold before, don't worry. Despite the many configuration options available, most `skaffold.yaml` files 
are pretty simple. You can see an example Skaffold file [here](#example-skaffold-file).

### Start the dev cluster
Once you have a valid skaffold file, you can create a dev clustering by running:

### Stopping and deleting the dev cluster
To stop the skaffold process, you can press `Ctrl+C`, or if you started the dev cluser in quiet mode, run 
`uffizzi dev stop` in another terminal. If you stop the skaffold process, it will halt file synchronization, 
but it will not delete the dev cluster. To do that you can run `uffizzi dev delete`, which will destroy the 
entire dev cluster and all of its resources, including any persistent volumes you've created.

## Comparison to Skaffold Dev

The [`uffizzi dev`](/docs/cli/commands/dev) command is a convenience wrapper around [`uffizzi cluster`](/docs/cli/commands/cluster) and 
[`skaffold dev`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/workflows/dev/) commands. It manages the lifecycle of Uffizzi 
virutal clusters (creates, updates, and deletes necessary resources) and automatically configures Skaffold 
for use with Uffizzi. Additionally, `uffizzi dev` provides sensible default configurations, such as using Uffizzi Cloud's ephemeral registry 
`registry.uffizzi.com` to temporarily store build artifacts. For a full list of command options, see the [CLI reference](/docs/cli/commands/dev).

### Example Skaffold File

Skaffold files are relatively simple files that at a minium define `build` and `manifest` components. 
Most of the configuration happens in your Charts or manifests, not in the `skaffold.yaml` file itself. 
For example, this is the skaffold file we use for developing the Uffizzi Cloud platform, which despite 
being comprised of a half a dozen services, is only about 20 lines of YAML:

```yaml filename="skaffold.yaml"
apiVersion: skaffold/v4beta6
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: uffizzi-platform
    context: .
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    sync:
      infer:
      - "**/*"
manifests:
  helm:
    releases:
      - name: uffizzi
        chartPath: "charts/uffizzi-platform"
        skipBuildDependencies: true
        valuesFiles:
          - ".helm_values.yaml"
```
