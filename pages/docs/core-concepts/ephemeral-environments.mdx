# Ephemeral Environments

Ephemeral environments, unlike traditional persistent staging or production environments, are created on-demand and are intended to be short-lived, existing only as long as they are needed. Some example use cases for ephemeral environments include:  

- Individual developer environments
- Feature branch environments
- Pull request environments
- Testing environments
- Debugging / hotfix environments
- Release candidate environments
- Staging environments

In addition to their ephemeral nature, they are also provide isolation from other ephemeral development and test environments, making them a perfect companion to IDPs.
