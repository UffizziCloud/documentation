# Compose Environments

In addition to Kubernetes virtual clusters and dev clusters, Uffizzi supports ephemeral environments 
created from Docker Compose files. Compose environments are useful for previewing multi-container 
applications on Uffizzi without the need to create a full Kubernetes virtual cluster. Compose 
environments are also useful for previewing applications that are not yet ready for Kubernetes.  

## Uffizzi-flavored Compose
Since Docker Compose is designed for local development, there are some discrepancies when translating 
this configuration into a cloud-based environment, most notably the concept of an Ingress. Therefore, 
Uffizzi uses its own flavor of Docker Compose, which we call Uffizzi Compose.  

A [Uffizzi Compose file](/docs/compose-spec) is used to define and preview multi-container applications on the Uffizzi platform. 
Based on Docker Compose, a Uffizzi Compose file is a structured 
YAML format that provides Uffizzi with configuration details needed to preview an application. Uffizzi 
Compose utilizes the Docker Compose custom extension field, x-uffizzi, to specify configuration options 
used by Uffizzi. This means that all Uffizzi Compose files are valid Docker Compose v3.9 files; however, 
the reverse is not necessarily true since Uffizzi only supports a subset of the full Docker Compose 
specification.
