# Dev Clusters

Dev clusters are standard Uffizzi [virtual clusters](virtual-clusters) with additional developer tooling for building, testing, and auto-deploying 
your local project files. This means every time you save changes in your local IDE, your deployed services are hot reloaded, **without having to 
rebuild your containers**. Plus since the exectution environment is remote, you never have to worry about your local machine's resource constraints.

    Instead of rebuilding images on each save, your changes are serialized and sent to the dev cluster via gRPC calls, resulting in blazing fast refreshes ⚡️.

Dev clusters are great for everyday development and testing of your applications, especially for teams that want their development 
environments to more closely resemble production, such as using domains and TLS certificates for HTTPS, services meshes, and other components that aren't compatible with traditional 
local development.

## Benefits of Cloud-Based Development

Dev clusters automate the process of building, pushing, and deploying your project changes to a remote development cluster. 
Cloud-based dev environments offer many benefits compared to traditional local development, including: 
    - [More similar to production](production-like)
    - [Access to more CPU and memory](resource-quotas) for resource-intensive applications
    - Scalability and flexibility for microservices apps
    - Faster initial build times
    - Avoid accumulation of build artifacts on local machine
    - Application components available at public URLs or IP addresses
    - TLS certificates for HTTPS
    - Better team collaboration via shareable links 

## Working with Dev Clusters

### Create a Skaffold file
Uffizzi dev clusters require a [`skaffold.yaml`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/) configuration file 
that defines how your build artifacts are managed and where to find your application configuration files, such as 
Helm Charts or kustomizations. 

If you've never used Skaffold before, don't worry. Despite the many configuration options available, most `skaffold.yaml` files 
are pretty simple. You can see an example Skaffold file [here](#example-skaffold-file).

### Start the dev cluster
Once you have a valid skaffold file, you can create a dev clustering by running:

```bash
uffizzi dev start /path/to/skaffold.yaml
```

This command will provision a dev cluster on Uffizzi and start the Skaffold process on your local machine.
Anytime you save local changes, they will be synced and redeployed to the remote cluster.  

To learn more about incorporating Uffizzi dev cluster in your development workflow see this 
guide [Getting Started with Dev Clusters](/docs/dev-environments/dev-clusters).

## Comparison to Skaffold Dev

The [`uffizzi dev`](/docs/cli/commands/dev) command is a convenience wrapper around [`uffizzi cluster`](/docs/cli/commands/cluster) and 
[`skaffold dev`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/workflows/dev/) commands. It manages the lifecycle of Uffizzi 
virutal clusters (creates, updates, and deletes necessary resources) and automatically configures Skaffold 
for use with Uffizzi. Additionally, `uffizzi dev` provides sensible default configurations, such as using Uffizzi Cloud's ephemeral registry 
`registry.uffizzi.com` to temporarily store build artifacts. For a full list of command options, see the [CLI reference](/docs/cli/commands/dev).

### Example Skaffold File

Skaffold files are relatively simple files that at a minium define `build` and `manifest` components. 
Most of the configuration happens in your Charts or manifests, not in the `skaffold.yaml` file itself. 
For example, this is the skaffold file we use for developing the Uffizzi Cloud platform, which despite 
being comprised of a half a dozen services, is only about 20 lines of YAML:

```yaml filename="skaffold.yaml"
apiVersion: skaffold/v4beta6
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: uffizzi-platform
    context: .
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    sync:
      infer:
      - "**/*"
manifests:
  helm:
    releases:
      - name: uffizzi
        chartPath: "charts/uffizzi-platform"
        skipBuildDependencies: true
        valuesFiles:
          - ".helm_values.yaml"
```

See the official [Skaffold documentation](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/) for more information about Skaffold configuration files.
