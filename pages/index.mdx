# Uffizzi

Uffizzi helps teams build [internal developer platforms (IDPs)](/core-concepts/internal-developer-platform) in minutes, not months, by providing out-of-the-box [Kubernetes multi-tenancy](https://www.uffizzi.com/kubernetes-multi-tenancy), [cluster virtualization](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/virtual-clusters), cloud-based dev environments, customizable cluster templates, and more.

Uffizzi provides a foundation for building IDPs, so platform teams can build end-to-end workflows, giving every developer access to self-service, [ephemeral environments](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments) for development, testing, PRs, staging and more.

- Options for self-hosting, private cloud, or fully managed (SaaS)

## FAQ

<AccordionItem value="faq-1">
        <AccordionTrigger>
                Why build an internal developer platform (IDP)?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
                IDPs enforce standardization, increase developer productivity, and improve developer experienceâ€”not to mention elimintating piles of bash scripts, manual processes, and the maintenance headaches that come with them.


                IDPs are maintainable and scalable systems that can reduce hours spent:


                - On-boarding developers
                - Updating app configurations
                - Adding/Updating services and dependencies
                - Adding/Updating resources
                - Waiting for environment availability
                - Waiting for environment creation
                - Waiting on other teams
                - Rolling back failed deployments
                - Refactoring architecture
                - Debugging

                What are ephemeral environments?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
                Ephemeral environments, unlike traditional persistent staging or production environments, are created on-demand and are intended to be short-lived, existing only as long as they are needed. Some example use cases for ephemeral environments include:
                - Individual developer environments
                - Feature branch environments
                - Pull request environments
                - Testing environments
                - Debugging / hotfix environments
                - Release candidate environments
                - Staging environments
                - Demonstration / Trial environments


                In addition to their ephemeral nature, they are also provide isolation from other ephemeral development and test environments, making them a perfect companion to IDPs.

                What do you mean by "virtual clusters"?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
        Similar to the concept of virtual machines, Uffizzi virtual clusters are isolated Kubernetes clusters running on top of a host cluster. Uffizzi virtual clusters provide all the same functionality of real Kubernetes clusters, while being more convenient and lightweight, provisioning on-demand in a couple minutes.


        Each virtual cluster is a **_full implementation of the Kubernetes API_**, not just a namespace, so each developer can query his or her own instance of the K8s control plane. This means Uffizzi virtual clusters can safely support custom resource definitions (CRD), multiple namespaces, and other [low-level resources that are not within namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#not-all-objects-are-in-a-namespace).

        <AccordionTrigger>
                Can I bring my own manifests / Helm Charts / kustomizations?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>

                Yes! By providing a virtualization layer on top of Kubernetes, Uffizzi let's teams reuse their templates of choice, while providing a secure, multi-tenant environment for running them.

<AccordionItem value="faq-6">
        <AccordionTrigger>
                What kinds of Kubernetes resources are supported?
        </AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>
        In general, any Kubernetes resource that can be created in a regular cluster can be created in a Uffizzi virtual cluster. This includes custom resource definitions (CRDs) and namespaces, which are cluster-wide resources.
        The one exception to this is any resources that require node access, such as DaemonSets and hostPath volumes. These resources are not supported in Uffizzi virtual clusters since these they require host-level access.
