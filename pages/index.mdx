# Uffizzi

Uffizzi helps teams build internal developer platforms (IDPs) in minutes, not months, by providing out-of-the-box [Kubernetes multi-tenancy](https://www.uffizzi.com/kubernetes-multi-tenancy), [cluster virtualization](#why-virtual-clusters), cloud-based dev environments, customizable templating, and more. 

Uffizzi provides a foundation for building IDPs, so platform teams can build end-to-end workflows, giving every developer access to self-service, [ephemeral environments]() for development, testing, PRs, staging and more.
