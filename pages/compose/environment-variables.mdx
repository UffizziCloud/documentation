# Adding Environment Variables to Compose Environments

Environment variables are name/value pairs that are dynamically loaded into your containers at runtime. They are often used to pass configuration details to your application. Using environment variables instead of hard-coded values lets you keep environment-specific details out of your source code.  

You will add secrets in one of two ways, depending on which CI solution you choose:

## External CI  

If you're using an external CI provider, such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI, environment variables should be stored via your provider's interface and referenced in your [Docker Compose template](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/quickstart-compose/blob/main/docker-compose.uffizzi.yml) using the [`environment`](/compose/reference#environment) element.


!!! note
    Docker Compose element [`env_file`](/compose/reference#env_file) is not currently support for external CI providers.

## Uffizzi CI  

If you're using Uffizzi CI, you have two options for adding environment variables in your [Uffizzi Compose file](../references/compose-spec.md): `environment` or `env_file`.

* Use [`environment`](/compose/reference#environment) if you have a small number of environment variables to add. You can list your variables in an `environment` block within the service definition. For example, the following `docker-compose.uffizzi.yml` snippet adds two environment variables, `FOO` and `BAR`, to the `myservice` container:    
```yaml    
services:
    mysevice:
      image: example/myservice:latest
      environment:
        FOO: bar
        BAR: baz
```

* Use [`env_file`](/compose/reference#env_file) if you have a large number of enviroment variables that would otherwise clutter up your compose file. You can store your variables in a file within your repository and use the `env_file` component to specify the path to this file. For example, the following `docker-compose.uffizzi.yml` snippet tells Uffizzi to read the contents of `envs/myconfigs.env` and add them to the container `myservice`:  
```yaml
services:
    mysevice:
      image: example/myservice:latest
      env_file: ./envs/myconfigs.env
```
