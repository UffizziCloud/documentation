# Uffizzi Pro

Uffizzi Pro is a self-hosted option for teams looking to strike a balance between control and ease of use.  

With Uffizzi Pro you install the Uffizzi data plane on your own Kubernetes cluster, while the Uffizzi Cloud API (`app.uffizzi.com`) acts as the control plane. Requests from the CLI are routed through Uffizzi Cloud, while workloads run on your cluster. 

Uffizzi Pro offers all the same functionality as [Uffizzi Cloud](/cloud), with the added benefit of workloads running on your own host infrastructure.  

Similar to [Uffizzi Enterprise](/enterprise), you are responsible for the management and maintenance of your Kubernetes cluster, but this option also provides more flexibility and control over your infrastructure.
