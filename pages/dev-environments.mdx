# Development Environments

Cloud-based development environments are a common starting point for teams looking to build out their 
[Internal Developer Platform (IDP)](core-concepts/internal-developer-platform).  

Dev environments can be used to provide a consistent, self-service environment for developers to build and test their applications 
and can greatly reduce the time it takes to onboard new developers.
