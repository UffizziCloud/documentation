## Uffizzi Cloud and Enterprise Components

The following components are exclusive to [Uffizzi Cloud](/cloud) and [Uffizzi Enterprise](/enterprise) customers.

### Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

[Uffizzi Cloud](/cloud) and [Uffizzi Enterprise](/enterprise) support role-based access control (RBAC) for managing access to ephemeral environments. RBAC allows team administrators to create teams and assign roles to team members. Roles include:

 - **Owner** - Full access to all team resources
 - **Admin** - Full access to all team resources except for team management
 - **Developer** - Full access to all team resources except for team management and billing
 - **View Only** - Read-only access to all team resources  

 See [Role-based Access Control](/cloud/rbac) for more information.

### Cloud Dashboard

The Uffizzi Cloud Dashboard is a web-based user interface for managing ephemeral environments. From the dashboard, users can create virtual clusters, view deployment and application logs for troubleshooting, and manage their personal or team account.
