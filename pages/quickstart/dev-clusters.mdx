# Dev Cluster Quickstart

Create a [dev cluster](/core-concepts/ephemeral-environments/dev-clusters) and see your local changes deployed instantly. Similar to a virtual cluster, except you can deploy changes to the cluster without having to commit and push your changes to a remote repository.

## Prerequisites

- [Install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) `kubectl`
- [Install](../install) the Uffizzi CLI.
- [Create an account](https://app.uffizzi.com) on Uffizzi Cloud.

## Get started

In this quickstart, we'll use the Uffizzi CLI to create a dev cluster and a background process that will automatically build, test, and deploy changes from your local project directory to the remote cluster.

<Steps>  

### Clone the quickstart repo

  ```bash copy
  git clone https://github.com/UffizziCloud/quickstart.git && \
  cd quickstart
  ```

  This repo includes: 
  - A simple "Hello World" NodeJS application
  - A [`web.yaml`](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/quickstart/blob/main/k8s/web.yaml) manifest that includes a `service`, `ingress` and `deployment`.
  - A `skaffold.yaml` file for building and deploying your project files

### Create a dev cluster

Make sure you are in the root of the project directory, then run:

  ```bash copy
  uffizzi dev start
  # Start creating a cluster
  # Checking the cluster status...
  # Cluster with name: barrow-indigo was created.
  # ...
  # Press Ctrl+C to exit
  # Watching for changes...
  ```

  This command will: 
  - Start a dev cluster with a auto-generated name
  - Start a [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) process to build and deploy your project changes.  Alternatively, you can start a dev cluster in quiet mode (no output) 
    by running `uffizzi dev start -q`.
  - Update the current context of your kubeconfig file (so you can use `kubectl` to manage the cluster)  

Now each time you save changes to your files in you local project directory, your application will be auto-deployed. 

### Open the application

  ```bash copy
  uffizzi dev ingress open
  ```

  This command will open the application `ingress` in your default browser. You can read more about Uffizzi-provided ingress [here](/ingress).

### Deploy changes

Make a change to the application code, such as:

```js {7} filename="src/index.js" copy
'use strict';

const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use(express.static('public'));
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('I love Uffizzi!'))

const port = 8080
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))
```

### Stop the dev cluster

If you started the dev cluster in quiet mode (`-q`, `--quiet`), then you can stop the background dev process by running:  

  ```bash copy
  uffizzi dev stop
  ```

  Otherwise, you can stop the dev process by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window where you started the dev cluster.

### Delete the dev cluster

To permanently delete the cluster, including all persistent volumes and the namespace itself, run:  

```bash copy
uffizzi dev delete
```

Remember that your project files are stored locally, so there is no risk in delete the remote dev cluster, unless you have 
important data stored in the cluster. However, [this is not recommended](/handbook/dos-and-donts).
